Barrier:
    - Give the unit 99 defense
    - Give the unit a status effect of immunity
    - Problem comes from removing after being hit instead of for a set amount of turns (may rework to immune this turn)

Tower:
    - Have a status effect called range up that gives all magical abilities + range
    - Remove action token at start of each turn

Deactivate:
    - Treat as a simple heal skill that can only target oneself
    - Remove action token

Tremor:
    - Treat as an Aoe damage skill
    - Apply root status effect (same as Tower)

Rescue:
    - Gonna be a little hard to code but shouldn't be impossible
    - Make it a movement ability with the receiving unit getting the tp
